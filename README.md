# News_Recommendation_NLP
At present, the interest in news readers to access 
millions of news articles from numerous websites is rapidly 
increasing. News recommender systems shrink the information 
overload problem and provide easy accessibility to the content 
for users based on personalized interests. To solve this, I 
extensively used natural language processing techniques to 
categorize by topic name reflecting overall contents. I also 
extracted sentiments indicating the positive or negative content
to enable publications to work on their content refinement
